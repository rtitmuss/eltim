# Timer

A more advanced way to use eltim is as a timer to make dumb appliances smarter. This simple upgrade is much cheaper than replacing my existing appliances with new smart appliances.

TODO ... more instructions ...


## Hardware

The following parts are needed for each switch:

- Servo motor
- 3d printed finger
- Aluminum foil
- 20 cm wire

## Capacitive button presser

My washing machine and tumble dryer are started using a capacitive button. The following instructions are for a capacitive button presser.

Press fit the servo horn into the printed part:

Strip the end off the 20cm wire and hot glue this to the aluminum foil. This is needed to add capavitance so the button activates:

Not test to make sure that the button activies when the 3d printed finger touches the appliance switch.

Remove the finger from the servo. Power on eltim and wait for the servo to reset it's position, then install the finger in the open position.
